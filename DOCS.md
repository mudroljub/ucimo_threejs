* [Extrusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion): Create an array of 2D points, make a 2D shape, and create an extrusion (a 3D shape whose cross-sections are the given 2D shape).
* [SkyBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skybox_(video_games)): Using textures to create a "SkyBox": backgrounds images projected onto a cube surrounding the rendering region, which creates the illusion of distant 3D surroundings.
* [Sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)): Sprites are images (not attached to geometries/surfaces) displayed in a scene, always orthogonal to the camera. They can either appear in the 3D scene (useful as part of a particle effect) or rendered using screen coordinates (useful as part of a graphical user interface (GUI) or a heads-up display (HUD)).
* [Metaballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs): A effect where spheres move around and their surfaces merge and split; the surfaces are calculated by implicit functions and drawn using the "Marching Cubes" algorithm.
* [Constructive solid geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry): Create a new mesh from the union, intersection, or subtraction of two meshes. Uses the [ThreeCSG](http://github.com/chandlerprall/ThreeCSG/) library.
